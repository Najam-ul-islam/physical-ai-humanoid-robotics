# Prompt: Create Digital Twins & Physical Simulation Specification

## User Input

```
==================================================
Module 2: Digital Twins & Physical Simulation
==================================================

Module goal:
Demonstrate how simulation enables safe, scalable robotics development.



Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Gravity, collisions, dynamics
- Environment modeling
Outcome: Reader understands why physics simulation is critical

Chapter 2: Sensor Simulation
- LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs
- Noise and realism
Outcome: Reader can explain simulated perception pipelines

Chapter 3: Human–Robot Interaction & Unity
- High-fidelity rendering
- Interaction scenarios
Outcome: Reader understands the role of visual realism and interaction testing
```

## Response Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the "Digital Twins & Physical Simulation" module. The specification includes:

- User stories for physics simulation learning, sensor simulation understanding, and human-robot interaction visualization
- Functional requirements covering physics simulation, sensor simulation, and visualization capabilities
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Key entities and edge cases

The specification was validated against quality criteria and a checklist was created to ensure completeness. The feature branch `001-digital-twins-simulation` was created with the spec file at `specs/001-digital-twins-simulation/spec.md`.

## Outcome

Specification successfully created and ready for the next phase of development. The spec is comprehensive, testable, and technology-agnostic as required.

## Evaluation

The specification meets all requirements for user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria. It provides clear value to the target users (robotics students, engineers, and designers) while maintaining focus on the core goal of demonstrating how simulation enables safe, scalable robotics development.
