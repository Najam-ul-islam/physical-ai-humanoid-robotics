# Module 3: The AI–Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

This module introduces advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. Building on the simulation foundations from Module 2, we explore how AI powers robot perception, localization, and navigation systems that enable autonomous behavior.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn:
- Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Perception and localization systems using Isaac ROS and Visual SLAM
- Navigation and motion planning for humanoid movement using Nav2
- How perception, localization, and navigation form an integrated pipeline

## Module Connections

This module builds upon the simulation environments from Module 2 to develop and test AI-powered robot systems. The perception → localization → navigation pipeline you'll learn here forms the "brain" of autonomous robots and connects directly to the Vision-Language-Action systems in Module 4.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of basic AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with computer vision fundamentals
- Access to NVIDIA GPU hardware (recommended) for Isaac ecosystem tools
