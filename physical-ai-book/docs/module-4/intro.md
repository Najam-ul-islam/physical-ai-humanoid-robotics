# Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA) Systems

## Overview

This module explains how language, vision, and action converge into autonomous humanoid behavior through integrated systems. Building on all previous modules, we explore how Vision-Language-Action systems create truly autonomous robots that can understand and respond to human commands.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn:
- Voice-to-intent processing using speech-to-text and intent extraction
- Cognitive planning with LLMs for task decomposition and action sequencing
- How to integrate vision, language, and action into complete autonomous behaviors
- The capstone implementation of an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system

## Module Connections

This capstone module integrates all concepts from the previous three modules into a complete Vision-Language-Action pipeline. The voice → plan → navigate → perceive → manipulate flow brings together ROS 2 fundamentals, simulation environments, and AI-powered perception/navigation into a unified autonomous system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with large language models and their applications
- Basic understanding of cognitive architectures
