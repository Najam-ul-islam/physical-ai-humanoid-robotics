# Module 2: Digital Twins & Physical Simulation

## Overview

This module demonstrates how simulation enables safe, scalable robotics development using Gazebo for physics simulation, sensor simulation, and Unity for human-robot interaction. Building on the ROS 2 fundamentals from Module 1, we explore how digital twins accelerate robot development by providing risk-free testing environments.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn:
- Physics simulation with Gazebo, including gravity, collisions, and dynamics
- Sensor simulation techniques for LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs
- Human-robot interaction principles using Unity for high-fidelity rendering
- How simulation enables safe, scalable robotics development

## Module Connections

This module bridges the foundational ROS 2 concepts from Module 1 with the advanced AI-robot integration in Module 3. The simulation environments you'll learn here provide the safe testing grounds necessary before deploying perception and navigation systems on real hardware.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Familiarity with 3D visualization concepts
